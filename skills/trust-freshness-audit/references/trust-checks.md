# D-TRUST — trust & freshness

Twelve-field form for every check this skill owns, per
`<marketplace-root>/references/failure-taxonomy.md`. Implemented in
`scripts/detect_trust.py`, over `scripts/build_claim_table.py`'s output — see
`claim-table-contract.md` for that shape and `store-contract.md` for the raw
observation types read.

Each field below maps onto the seven items this skill's design brief asked for:
**mechanical observation** = `observable_signals` + `detection_test`;
**evidence** = `evidence_required`; **interpretation** = `mechanism` + the
deterministic detection test; **false-positive guardrails** =
`false_positive_rules`; **severity/confidence** = `severity` + `confidence`;
**recommendation** = `recommendation`; **validation** = `validation`.

The six analytical dimensions this skill's brief named map onto the checks as:
explicitness & attribution → D-TRUST-04; freshness/date signals → D-TRUST-01/02;
internal consistency → D-TRUST-03; corroboration → D-TRUST-05; conflicting
information → D-TRUST-03; possible identity confusion → D-TRUST-05's
`entity_match` guard (see below) — reusing `entity-semantic-audit`'s
`entity_profile` rather than re-deriving identity signals.

Governing rule, restated per-check where it applies: **never claim external
corroboration unless it was actually checked**, and **distinguish observed facts
from inference** — every finding here states what was mechanically found, never
what "seems true" or "is probably fine."

## D-TRUST-01 — undated time-sensitive claims
- **Meaning:** a sentence uses time-sensitive language ("currently", "this year",
  "now available") with no date signal anywhere on the same page.
- **Mechanism:** Appendix B/D. A citation pipeline repeating a time-framed claim
  with no way to judge its currency risks repeating something already false.
- **Applicability:** the page has `>=1` `time_sensitive` claim in the claim table.
- **Observable signals:** presence of a time-sensitive phrase-pattern match on
  the page; presence of any date signal for that page in `date_inventory`
  (`schema_dates`, `visible_dates`, or `header_date` — any one suffices).
- **Detection test:** fire when `>=1` time-sensitive claim exists on a page
  **and** `date_inventory[page]` has zero schema, visible, and header dates.
  Page-scoped, not sitewide — a date signal elsewhere on the site does not cover
  a claim on a different page.
- **Evidence required:** the claim's `id`/`text`/`observation_id`, and
  confirmation that `date_inventory[page]` is empty.
- **False-positive rules:** evergreen content (no time-sensitive phrase match)
  is never flagged — absence of a date is only interesting paired with a claim
  that needs one. A page with *any* date signal passes regardless of how many
  time-sensitive phrases it contains.
- **False-negative risks:** the phrase-pattern list is fixed and generic; a
  time-sensitive claim phrased outside that list is missed. Deliberate
  precision-over-recall trade, matching `entity-semantic-audit`'s established
  approach to the same tension.
- **Severity:** medium base. **Archetype re-threshold**
  (`archetype-applicability.md`): `publisher-editorial` up (freshness is
  central to that archetype); `documentation` and `personal-portfolio` down.
- **Confidence:** high — phrase-pattern presence and date-signal absence are
  both direct, deterministic tests, read through the rendered lens when
  available.
- **Recommendation:** add a visible "last updated" date or `dateModified`
  schema near the time-sensitive claim.
- **Validation:** re-fetch the page; a date signal is now present.

## D-TRUST-02 — stale signals
- **Meaning:** a forward-framed claim (an "upcoming" event, an offer with an end
  date, a countdown) carries a date that has already passed relative to the
  audit time. Copyright age alone does not establish content staleness.
- **Mechanism:** Appendix B/D. A stale forward-framed claim is actively
  misleading if repeated, not merely uninformative.
- **Applicability:** a `dated_offer`/`dated_event` claim exists with an
  extractable date.
- **Observable signals:** the claim's extracted date compared against
  `audited_at`.
- **Detection test:** two independent sub-triggers, each requiring the
  forward-framing pattern *and* a date, never a stale date alone: (a) an
  "upcoming"/"next" event dated before `audited_at`; (b) an "ends"/"until"/
  "sale" claim dated before `audited_at`. Both additionally require that the page's
  own date inventory (schema or visible dates) has **no** date on or before
  the claim's extracted date — see the false-positive rule below.
- **Evidence required:** the claim text, the extracted date, `audited_at`, and
  the computed gap.
- **False-positive rules:** historical/archival pages are not flagged for being
  old by themselves — the forward-framing pattern must co-occur with the past
  date. **Critically, "the page was published/updated on or before the claim's
  date" also suppresses (a) and (b) entirely**: a news article or blog post
  published in 2020 that discusses "the upcoming election on November 3,
  2020" was true when written — it is an accurate historical record, not a
  stale claim, and firing on it was a confirmed false-positive class (a
  hostile review found this on any site with editorial/press history). The
  sub-trigger fires only when the page has no such earlier date, or was
  itself published/modified *after* the claim's date and is still presenting
  it as forward-looking — the genuine currency bug this check exists to
  catch. Copyright dates identify rights, not content review or expiry dates.
- **False-negative risks:** a stale claim phrased without any of the fixed
  forward-framing patterns is missed; same deliberate precision trade as
  D-TRUST-01.
- **Severity:** medium base, same archetype re-threshold as D-TRUST-01.
- **Confidence:** high — date arithmetic against a fixed reference point is
  fully deterministic.
- **Recommendation:** update or remove the stale date-bound claim, offer, or
  event.
- **Validation:** re-fetch; the extracted date is no longer past relative to
  its framing, or the stale claim has been removed or updated.

## D-TRUST-03 — internal contradiction
- **Meaning:** two pages assert different normalized values for the same
  entity-level fact.
- **Mechanism:** Appendix B/D. Conflicting asserted values give a citation
  pipeline no reliable single fact to repeat and may cause it to prefer a
  stale or wrong version.
- **Applicability:** `>=2` `entity_fact` claims share the same `key`.
- **Observable signals:** the normalized `value` per claim of a given `key`
  (currency/number formatting, whitespace, and case normalized before
  comparison).
- **Detection test:** fire when two claims sharing a `key` have different
  normalized `value`s.
- **Evidence required:** both claim texts, both values, both `source_url`s and
  `observation_id`s — every finding quotes both sides.
- **False-positive rules:** **scope is deliberately narrow.** Only
  inherently entity-level, rarely-legitimately-variant facts are ever extracted
  as `entity_fact` claims — founding year and employee/customer count. Price,
  spec, and other per-product/plan facts are never extracted into this claim
  type at all, because they legitimately vary by product, plan, or region on
  almost every commercial site; attempting a generic "any two numbers differ"
  test on those would be exactly the kind of false-positive class this
  taxonomy is built to avoid (see `PHASE1-ANALYSIS.md` §5.2). Regional/variant
  pricing and multiple locations are consequently structurally out of this
  check's scope, not merely suppressed by a rule. **Contact phone was
  extracted here in an earlier version and was removed** after a hostile
  review found that a sales line and a support line — a near-universal
  pattern, not an edge case — were flagged as a high-severity, high-confidence
  "contradiction." A bare phone-shaped number has no department/location
  context, so it belongs with price as a structurally-excluded fact, not a
  comparable one; a genuine same-number-should-match-itself use case would
  need context this deterministic pattern can't establish.
- **False-negative risks:** a genuine contradiction stated only in free prose
  (not matching one of the fixed entity-fact patterns) is invisible to this
  deterministic test. A future LLM-instrument extension (judging whether two
  prose sentences assert conflicting facts) is a documented, not required,
  upgrade path — this skill's brief prefers deterministic comparison first,
  and the fixed-pattern set already covers the highest-confidence, lowest-FP
  cases.
- **Severity:** high.
- **Confidence:** high — exact-match comparison after normalization.
- **Recommendation:** reconcile the two values, or state explicitly why they
  differ (e.g. label distinct time periods or entities).
- **Validation:** re-extract; the two values now match or carry an explicit
  distinguishing label.

## D-TRUST-04 — unattributed falsifiable claims
- **Meaning:** a falsifiable ranking claim or statistic ("#1", "leading",
  "94% of customers") appears with no citation nearby.
- **Mechanism:** Appendix B. An assistant repeating an unsourced falsifiable
  claim as fact inherits the risk of it being wrong or outdated, with no way to
  check.
- **Applicability:** `>=1` `superlative_stat` claim exists sitewide.
- **Observable signals:** the matched claim pattern; presence of a citation
  (a link, footnote marker, or "according to ..." phrase) within a fixed word
  window of the match.
- **Detection test:** fire, **once, aggregated sitewide** (never one finding
  per occurrence), when `>=1` `superlative_stat` claim has `attributed: false`.
- **Evidence required:** every unattributed claim's text and `source_url`,
  aggregated into one finding.
- **False-positive rules:** restricted to a fixed pattern set of specific
  falsifiable ranking phrases and numeric statistics — ordinary marketing
  adjectives ("great", "high-quality", "amazing") are never matched at all,
  not merely tolerated. Always a single aggregated finding, never fragmented
  per URL (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` Defect D / D-7).
- **False-negative risks:** a falsifiable claim phrased outside the fixed
  pattern set is missed; deliberate precision trade.
- **Severity:** low (capped — per `failure-taxonomy.md` revision log, this
  would otherwise fire on nearly every marketing site alive).
- **Confidence:** high — pattern match and citation-proximity are both direct
  tests.
- **Recommendation:** add a source next to each falsifiable claim, or rephrase
  as non-falsifiable language where no source exists.
- **Validation:** re-fetch; the claim now carries a nearby citation or has
  been rephrased.

## D-TRUST-05 — externally unsupported or contradicted claim, with an identity-confusion guard
- **Meaning:** inspected independent evidence did not support a selected claim,
  or directly contradicted it — *and that result was actually checked*, never
  assumed from missing search capability.
- **Mechanism:** Appendix B/D. A claim repeated only by its own source is
  weaker evidence than one corroborated independently; conversely, a
  "corroborating" source that is actually about a *different, similarly named*
  entity is worse than no corroboration at all — it would misattribute that
  entity's facts to this one.
- **Applicability:** a `CLAIM_CORROBORATION` observation exists for the claim
  with `performed: true`. **Absent that record, this check does not fire at
  all** — never inferred, never treated as "no corroboration exists"
  (`corroboration-honesty.md`, hard rule).
- **Observable signals:** the corroboration record's `sources` list; each
  source's `assessment` (`supports`, `contradicts`, `mentions`, or `unrelated`)
  and `entity_match` — whether it was confirmed to describe *this* entity
  (cross-checked against `entity_profile`'s canonical name, type, and location/
  identity-anchor — the same fields `entity-semantic-audit` builds), not a
  same-named but different one.
- **Detection test:** a confirmed-same-entity source assessed `supports`
  suppresses the finding. A confirmed-same-entity `contradicts` source fires a
  high-severity contradiction finding. Otherwise fire the medium unsupported
  finding, distinguishing empty results, different/unconfirmed entities, and
  confirmed-same-entity mentions that do not establish the claim.
- **Evidence required:** the corroboration record's `query`, `method`,
  `timestamp`, and full `sources` list (even the non-matching ones, so the
  identity-confusion case is auditable).
- **False-positive rules:** never fires without a real, `performed: true`
  record. Never treats an `entity_match: false` source as if it were
  corroboration (the opposite failure mode is just as dishonest as claiming
  unchecked corroboration). `entity_match` itself is never granted from a bare
  name match: a source whose text explicitly disambiguates itself from the
  entity ("not affiliated with", "not to be confused with", ...) is never
  scored a match regardless of any other signal — a hostile review found that
  without this guard, a disclaimer *warning about* a name collision was being
  scored as *confirming* corroboration, exactly inverting this check's
  purpose (`_trust_util.source_matches_entity`'s `_DISAMBIGUATION_RE` guard).
  A bare mention never counts as support. Corroboration requests themselves are
  also scoped: only `entity_fact` claims
  and unattributed `superlative_stat` claims are ever worth checking
  externally (`_trust_util.is_corroboration_worthy`) — a `time_sensitive` or
  `dated_offer`/`dated_event` claim needs a date, not a second opinion, and
  spending the shared corroboration budget on one is a wasted, unnecessary
  lookup.
- **False-negative risks:** entirely dependent on the invoking agent completing
  the issued search request and inspecting suitable source pages. Unavailable or
  incomplete agent search is an honestly declared coverage gap, never a silent pass.
- **Severity:** medium when unsupported or identity-confused; high when an
  inspected confirmed-same-entity source directly contradicts the claim.
- **Confidence:** high — given inspected evidence exists, the detector applies
  deterministic rules to its entity-match and assessment fields.
- **Recommendation:** for high-visibility claims lacking corroboration, build
  an external presence (press mention, directory listing, review platform)
  that states the same fact independently and unambiguously about this entity.
- **Validation:** re-run verification; `>=1` source now exists with
  `entity_match: true` and `assessment: supports`, and no confirmed source
  contradicts the claim.

## D-TRUST-06 — organizational opacity
- **Meaning:** no about page, no contact information, and/or substantive
  article content with no named author, anywhere on the site.
- **Mechanism:** Appendix B/D. A citation pipeline weighing whether to trust and
  repeat a claim has no visible accountability trail to check.
- **Applicability:** always evaluable; archetype-gated at the detection test
  (see below), never suppressed by absence alone without that gate.
- **Observable signals:** classified accountability roles, named structured
  operators, explicit operator prose, email/telephone links, message forms,
  structured postal contacts, and exact conventional role-path fallbacks.
  Named authors may appear in JSON-LD graphs, metadata, `itemprop`, `rel=author`,
  or visible bylines; an empty author link does not name an author.
- **Detection test:** two independent sub-triggers. (a) fires when **both**
  operator-identity and contact signals are both absent from sampled pages.
  (b) evaluates each fetched `article` page independently and reports only
  anonymous articles, with evaluated article count as the denominator.
- **Evidence required:** the pages searched for about/contact signals; the
  article pages checked for authorship.
- **False-positive rules:** personal blogs and single-purpose landing pages
  have different norms — **suppressed entirely on `personal-portfolio`**
  (the site's own existence typically functions as the "about", and its
  author is self-evident). Sub-trigger (a) requires *both* signals absent, never
  either alone. Sub-trigger (b) requires `>=1` article page to even be
  applicable — a site with no article-type content is never penalized for
  lacking bylines.
- **False-negative risks:** an about/contact page that exists but is
  extremely thin (e.g. a single sentence) still counts as present — this
  check tests presence, not adequacy, by design, to stay mechanical and
  low-FP.
- **Severity:** medium.
- **Confidence:** high — presence/absence checks are direct and deterministic.
- **Recommendation:** add an about page stating who operates the site, a
  contact method, and named authorship on article content.
- **Validation:** re-crawl; about/contact pages exist and/or articles carry a
  named author.

Percentage/superlative attribution checks exclude code/preformatted examples and
navigation chrome. They retain external citation hrefs in nearby paragraphs or list
items rather than discarding this attribution when converting HTML to text. This
establishes presence of attribution, not independent validation of the linked claim.
