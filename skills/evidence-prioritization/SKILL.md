name: evidence-prioritization
description: Owns the scoring and prioritization policy for the marketplace - the single place where a finding's importance is decided. Normalizes findings from every detector into one shape, aggregates per-URL repetitions of a template-level defect into one finding with an affected-scope count, deduplicates overlapping findings across skills, assigns confidence from evidence strength, computes severity from a published matrix rather than judgement, demotes low-confidence findings to proactive suggestions, applies a distribution guard against severity inflation, and ranks the result. Fully deterministic. Use as part of a website AI-readiness audit.

# Evidence Prioritization

## When to use

Invoked by `audit-orchestrator` after all four detectors have returned unscored findings.

## This is a policy, not a pipeline stage

Scoring must be consistent across all four detectors. If it lived inside each of them,
four different severity philosophies would emerge. It is isolated for the same reason a
pricing policy is isolated from the four teams that quote prices.

## Tool requirements

Read [shared runtime and safety requirements](../../references/skill-runtime.md)
before execution. Keep the full marketplace and shared library together. Commands
below run from this skill directory; use absolute input/output paths when needed.
Only the orchestrator collects remotely; other skills read local evidence. Do not
repeat stages already run by the orchestrator. Local `--out` files may be overwritten.

## Inputs

A JSON list of pooled unscored findings (`--findings`) plus optional store metadata
(`--store`) for scope and page importance. The Python API is
`prioritize_findings(findings, store)`.

## Explicitly NOT this skill's job

- Detecting anything about the site
- Creating a finding. It may only merge, demote, rank or drop.
- Fetching anything

## Procedure

1. Normalize to the finding schema.
2. Aggregate by `(check_id, template_cluster)` — never by URL.
3. Deduplicate across skills per [references/dedupe-rules.md](references/dedupe-rules.md).
4. Assign confidence per [references/confidence-model.md](references/confidence-model.md).
5. Compute severity per [references/severity-matrix.md](references/severity-matrix.md). `critical` is capped to the
   total-invisibility list in that file and requires high-confidence scope evidence; other checks cannot reach critical through modifiers.
6. Demote findings below the confidence floor into `demoted[]` (proactive suggestions).
7. Distribution guard: if more than 30% land in high+critical, re-check scope and
   importance modifiers and write a calibration log.
8. Rank.

## Scripts

Deterministic throughout — no model call is required or used:

| Script | Role | CLI |
|---|---|---|
| [scripts/normalize.py](scripts/normalize.py) | Normalizes severity/confidence casing, rejects unsupported findings ([references/evidence-validation.md](references/evidence-validation.md)), drops confidence for thin-sample findings | `python scripts/normalize.py --findings <path> [--out <path>]` |
| [scripts/aggregate_dedupe.py](scripts/aggregate_dedupe.py) | Merges the same check/subtype with overlapping affected samples, transitively per [references/dedupe-rules.md](references/dedupe-rules.md) | `python scripts/aggregate_dedupe.py --findings <path> [--out <path>]` |
| [scripts/score.py](scripts/score.py) | Runs the full pipeline: normalize -> dedupe -> score ([references/severity-matrix.md](references/severity-matrix.md)) -> demote ([references/confidence-model.md](references/confidence-model.md)) -> distribution guard -> rank -> cross-link | `python scripts/score.py --findings <path> [--store <path>] [--out <path>]` |

## Determinism

No model calls. Given the same findings and store metadata, output is byte-identical.

## Outputs

An object containing `findings`, `demoted`, `rejected`, `merge_log` and
`calibration_log`. Kept findings are scored, ranked and assigned final IDs.
Run `score.py` once; do not separately normalize/merge and then score again.
Diagnostic substep CLIs emit envelopes: pass the contained list, not the envelope,
to the next substep.

## Dependencies

- [../../lib/](../../lib/) — reads store metadata for scope and page importance only.
  Never fetches, never detects. See the package's single-collection contract.
- [../../references/failure-taxonomy.md](../../references/failure-taxonomy.md) — check ID registry

Shared output semantics: [finding contract](../../references/finding-contract.md).
